# Scrapping_Oil_Bulletin
A tool to scrap Daily/Monthly oil price

This tools is designed to help scrap daily/monthly oil prices for various domestic grades of shale/crude in US. 
Various midstream companies post the prices daily at/around 07:00 am for their terminals/pipelines/gathering systems. This helps us to get a better idea of demand of various local grades, the price differential, competing crudes and the net cost of crude at the gate of the refinery.
